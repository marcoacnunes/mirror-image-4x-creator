# Image-Mirror-Generator

This project is a web application that allows you to upload an image, which then generates four distinct mirrored copies of your image.

## Description

1. Mirrored to the right and downwards.
2. Mirrored to the left and downwards.
3. Mirrored upwards and to the left.
4. Mirrored upwards and to the right.

## Usage
